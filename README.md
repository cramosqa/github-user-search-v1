## Introduction

This is a basic project that search for a user on github and then returns a few of the user data and it's repositories's names and descriptions.

## Demo

## How to get up and running

Clone or download the repo

- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run the project in development mode

## How to commit into this repo?

- `git commit` since this repo uses husky and cli commitlint, a frindly cli will appear to help you commit a clear message

## Disclaimer

The github api is public and it has a limit of 60 request for a unauthenticated user

## 1. Introduction

Web page to allow user search for a GitHub user and retrieve user information.

## 2. Objectives

Ensure the GitHub User Search Web Page functions correctly by accurately retrieving user data from the GitHub database based on user input.

## 3. Scope

This test plan covers the functionality and usability of the GitHub User Search Web Page.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

Testers: Responsible for executing the test cases and reporting any issues.
Developers: Responsible for fixing reported issues and enhancing the functionality as required.

## 5. Test Environment

Describe the test environment, including hardware, software, and network configurations.

## 6. Test Strategy

Explain the overall testing approach, including techniques, methodologies, and tools to be used.

Unit Tests:
Test individual components, functions, or modules of the frontend codebase.
Verify that each function behaves as expected in isolation.
Mock dependencies such as API calls to simulate different scenarios.
Integration Tests:
Test the interaction between different components, including frontend UI, backend API, and external services like the GitHub API.
Ensure that components work together as intended and handle data flow correctly.
End-to-End (E2E) Tests:
Test the entire application flow from user input to displaying results on the page.
Use automated testing tools to simulate real user interactions and verify expected behavior.
Validate that the application behaves correctly across different browsers and devices.
Functional Tests:
Test the functional requirements of the application.
Verify that the user can input a GitHub username, submit the form, and receive relevant information about the user from the GitHub database.
User Interface (UI) Tests:
Test the appearance and usability of the web page.
Ensure that UI elements are correctly displayed and responsive across various screen sizes and devices.
Validate that the UI follows design guidelines and is intuitive for users to interact with.
Performance Tests:
Measure the performance of the web page under different conditions.
Test the response time of search requests to the GitHub API.
Verify that the page loads quickly and remains responsive, even under heavy load.
Security Tests:
Test for vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
Ensure that sensitive data, such as access tokens, is handled securely.
Validate that input validation and sanitization are effective in preventing malicious input.
Accessibility Tests:
Ensure that the web page is accessible to users with disabilities.
Test for compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
Verify that assistive technologies can interpret and interact with the page's content effectively.
Regression Tests:
Re-run previously executed tests to ensure that recent code changes have not introduced new bugs or regressions.
Maintain a suite of regression tests to cover critical functionalities and edge cases.
Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Tests:
Test the web page's compatibility across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Validate that the page renders correctly and functions as expected on various devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

## 7. Test Cases

A. User Interface
UI Layout Test: Verify that the UI elements (input field, search button) are displayed correctly.
Responsiveness Test: Ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Input Validation Test: Check if the input field accepts valid GitHub usernames only.
Error Handling Test: Verify appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or server errors.
B. Functionality
User Search Test: Enter a valid GitHub username and verify that the corresponding user data is retrieved and displayed correctly.
Empty Search Test: Leave the input field empty and ensure an appropriate message is displayed.
Non-existent User Test: Enter a GitHub username that does not exist and verify that a relevant message is displayed.
Search Button Functionality Test: Verify that pressing the search button triggers the search action.
Loading Indicator Test: Verify that a loading indicator is displayed while user data is being fetched from the server.
C. Performance
Response Time Test: Measure the time taken to retrieve user data for different scenarios (e.g., existing user, non-existent user).
Load Testing: Simulate heavy traffic by sending multiple concurrent search requests and ensure the system handles them without crashing or slowing down significantly.
D. Security
Input Sanitization Test: Verify that the input is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
Data Privacy Test: Ensure that sensitive user data is not exposed in the search results.

## 8. Test Execution

Detail the process for executing tests, including any prerequisites or setup instructions.
Perform manual testing based on the test cases outlined above.
Use automated testing tools where applicable to improve efficiency.
Record any issues encountered during testing along with steps to reproduce them.

## 9. Test Reporting

Describe how test results will be documented, including formats and tools used for reporting.

Document the test results including pass/fail status for each test case.
Provide detailed information about any defects found, including screenshots or logs if necessary.
Communicate the test results to the development team for further action.

## 10. Test Closure

Outline the process for closing out the testing effort, including reviewing test results, addressing defects, and obtaining sign-off.
Review the test results with the development team and address any unresolved issues.
Obtain sign-off from relevant stakeholders once all issues are resolved and the system is deemed ready for deployment.
